# ðŸª™ Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

An end-to-end ML project to forecast gold prices using market indicators (SPX, GLD, USO, SLV, EUR/USD) and multiple regression models (Linear Regression, SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN).:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## ðŸ”¬ Background & Objectives

The goal is to build a reliable, data-driven framework for predicting gold price movements by learning patterns from historical market data. We leverage diverse algorithms to capture linear and non-linear relationships and compare their performance for practical forecasting.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Why this matters**
- Helps investors and analysts assess risk and hedge positions.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- Turns multi-market signals (equities, commodities, FX) into actionable insights.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**Scope (high level)**
- Inputs (features): Date, S&P 500 (SPX), Gold (GLD), Oil (USO), Silver (SLV), EUR/USD.:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
- Models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN.:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
